#Building the app

Once you have the Android SDK installed, MIT Mobile for Android can be built with Eclipse or via the command line.

1. Create your own `build-deployment/build_settings.py` from `build-deployment/build_settings.py.init`
2. Adjust your `build_settings.py` to match your environment. A Google Maps API key is required for a fully functional map in the app.
3. Run `python build-deployment/build_local.py` to build from the command line.
